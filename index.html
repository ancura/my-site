			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>I am a Front-End Web Developer, looking to hone my skills. I love to write code, and iterate through challenges. I am ambitious and always looking to improve on what I've learned. So far I have experience working with HTML, CSS and some Javascript, but I remain curious and open to learning more. Short term I hope to get hired as an entry-level Web Developer and I am determined to one day join a team of coders working to make the world a better place.</p>
